Jun: What's up?
- Artifact
	Aya: So what's this artifact you're searching for?
	Jun: Oh!
	Jun: I've heard rumours round' the grape vine that in some dank tomb holds a piece of art so beautiful.
	Jun: It could rival the gods' own creations.
	Jun: After narrowin' it down this seems to be the likeliest place for it ta' be.
	Aya: ...And you plan to steal and sell this artwork?
	Jun: W-well steal is an awfully strong word...
	Aya: Right...
	Aya: Maybe it's best you leave it here, perhaps simply seeing it would be satisfactory.
	Aya: (Honestly it may be best you left this place entirely.)
	Jun: I-I mean I don't think it would be wrong to take it right?
	Jun: I mean it's not like anyone owns it no more.
	Aya: It's literally been placed in a dungeon to keep it from being taken.
	Jun: ...
	Jun: Let's talk about something else!
	=> jun_talk
- Origin
	Aya: You say you're not from around here correct?
	Aya: What foreign land do you hail from then?
	Jun: Ahh I come from the west. It's a whole lot bigger o'er there compared to here.
	Aya: I have heard. Is the artifact the only thing that brought you to come here?
	Jun: No no far from it. I've wanted to come here for a while now.
	Jun: The tales'a this place make it sound incredible. Great food. Great views. Great people.
	Jun: Unfortunately I don't think I'll get to experience those anytime soon seeing as I'm stuck down in this here dungeon.
	Aya: R-right. Apologies, it is an unfortunate situation.
	Jun: Issalright' I mean, I'm getting to experience the great people as we speak aren't I?
	Aya: I don't exactly think I'd consider myself the best this land has to offer but thank you.
	Aya: Perhaps when we both get out of this dungeon I can show you around? Get us some of that great food you came here for?
	Jun: Well that sounds just dandy don't it. I'd love to, Aya.

- Species
	Aya: Apologies for asking this so bluntly but...
	Aya: What exactly are you?
	Jun: I'm a shopkeep!
	Aya: ...
	Aya: (Lord kunin mo na ako)
	Aya: ehehehe no no, apologies. What species are you exactly?
	Jun: Ahh ya' coulda' just said that!
	Jun: I'm a thunderbird harpy!
	Jun: Nothing too impressive honestly. I'm just a lady with wings and feathers.
	Aya: Ahh I see, your physiology is quite interesting. I'd be interested in getting a better look.
	Jun: W-well you can of course.
	(You lean in closer)
	Aya: Such pretty plumage. Are these wings your ears?
	Jun: A-A-Ahh no they just keep me warm and protect my ears.
	Aya: Very interesting. They are indeed attached right above where a human's ears should be. So fascinating.
	Aya: I wonder if you have any nerve endings-
	Jun: !!!
	Jun: A-A-ALRIGHT THAT'S ENOUGH!
	Jun: *scoffs
	Jun: Ahem. That's enough. My wings are very sensitive.
	Aya: Ahh r-right apologies.
