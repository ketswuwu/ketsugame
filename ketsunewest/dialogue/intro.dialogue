You creek your eyes open slightly, your vision is blurry.
You hear indistinct chatting.
???: Malapit na... 
???: ...
???: Huy, nagigising-
Mayari: Huh?
Mayari: A-ano? Anong nangyayari?
Aga: Ok lang yan.
Mayari: A-aga? H-hello?
Aga: Mmmm... Hello, Aya.
Mayari: W-what's happe-
Aga: Ssshhhhh
Aga places places their pointer finger on your lower lip.
Aga: It's ok, Aya, just stay still ok.
Mayari: Why? What's happening.
Aga: Don't even worry about it. Just stay calm.
Mayari: I-I am why do you keep repeating...
You try to move your limbs. You are unable to. Your wrists and legs are restrained.
Mayari: Hey! W-why am I bolted down.
Aga: It's fine, Aya. Just calm down and let this happen...
Mayari: L-let what happen!?
Your vision clears. You see Aga towering over you with a strange object in his hand.
Mayari: W-what are you doing? G-get me out this isn't funny, Aga!
Aga: This is for your own good, Aya. You'll be thanking me soon.
Mayari: For what!??
set State.intro = "cutscene2"
Aga lifts the object into the light. You can see it clearly. Some sort of rock.
Aga: Soon you'll see, Aya, you'll be like me. Don't you want that? For us to be connected?
Aga smiles at you with a genuine smile. His teeth clear in view. His fangs on display.
Mayari: W-what the hell!? G-gagi ka! What are you?
Aga: Do the fangs not give it away? Don't you want to be a strong Aswang like me?
Mayari: Y-you're a... N-no! I don't want to. So you can stop now! 
Aga: Hmphh, and here I thought you were a good choice to recruit.
Aga: Guess you're just like the others. I'll have to force it down just like with them.
Mayari: ... W-what?
Mayari: P-pot- Mfghh
Aga forces down the stone down your throat. It's agony. You feel yourself changing. Transforming.
Your forehead hurts. Your hairs stand up. Teeth feel like they're rotting as your canines elongate...
...
set State.intro = "cutscene3"
Mayari: That's what happened...
Mayari: And now I'm an Aswang. A monster of the night. 
Mayari: But I didn't join his disgusting group. Instead I am back for revenge. I'll find Aga, and bring and end to him.
...
Weeks later.
set State.intro = "cutscene4"
Aga: AHAAHAHAHA! You're beautiful, Aya!
Aga: You've bloomed into such a wonderful ghoulish creature! Grateful aren't you?
Mayari: Hell no, idiot. Just quit running already.
Aga: You know if you weren't an Aswang you couldn't even get close to catching up to me...
Mayari: Tumahimik ka! Just get over here and die already!
Aga: Ahahaha! No.
Aga: If you really want me that badly. Come and get me!
Aga floats off and descends a flight of cobbled stairs. Ruins.
Mayari: You're not getting away that easily...
You pursue him down into the depths of this ancient sanctuary. What might you find down there in your pursuit of revenge?
